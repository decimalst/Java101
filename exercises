Exercises:

1. Guessing game
	1. Generate a random number from 1-10
	2. Ask the user to guess a random number.
	3. If the user guesses the right number,
	 tell them they were correct, and end the game
	4. If the user guesses wrong, 
	tell them to guess higher or lower, depending on their answer
Hint: Try using a while loop with a boolean condition





2. Try making the same guessing game using a Do-While loop

3. Make a program that prints all the numbers divisible by 3 from 1-50. Do this with a while loop and with a for loop.

4. A prime number is a number that's only divisible by itself and 1. For example, 5 is a prime number, because the only factors it has are 1 and 5. 
4 is not a prime number, since (2 x 2) = 4, and so does (4 x 1).
Make a program that prints all the prime numbers from 1-100.
Hint: Use modulo.

5. A palindrome is a phrase or sentence that is the same backwards or forwards.
For example, "racecar" is the same backwards and forward. So is "a car, a man, a maraca"(Ignoring punctuation). 
There are plenty of other examples you can find on the internet. Try making a program that can take a string as input, and print if it's a palindrome or not.
